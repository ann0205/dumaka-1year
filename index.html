          (11-11-24)
So this was basically the day ik I liked you, During the hackathon I had so much fun with you and i liked laughed after a long time with you only, and the fact that I kept annoying you and you talked to my friends for me made me more happy.
After the hackathon walking around with you and having lunch with you it felt really nice, you were "THE WALL" still that was basically what I liked most about youu.</p>

        <p>Okay this is the last slide, 4 slides ain't enuf to talk abt us but yah 
Other than those three i just love being around u and with you, ur stupid ass jokes, how u try to make me less mad, how I can neverrr be too mad at ya, also how hott u r to resist around (very difficult btw), Ik i can be completely crazyyy and baby around you, also i lovee it when u r weird and giving the mosttt absurd reasons as justifications when we playfully fight
All the moments with you from the start have made me really really happy and I never thought it's possible... U literally made a person who gave up on all of this relationship stuff fall in love with you crazily (does not make u GOAT) 
that toh only I AM 

<p>Now I'm signing off and I'll see you next year 
Gosh u r soo lucky to have me hehehe 🤭</p>

<p>P.S. I lovee youu more ❤️ (and i win the battle with this bang on suprise) and yes suprises does count as a factor for this battle. </p>
